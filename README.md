### :zap: [AI Product/Service Ideation Task]()
For this solo project, titled *ML-Powered Form Autofill Application*, I propose the idea of creating a browser extension and API that automates form-filling tasks using Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
This service, if implemented successfully, will significantly enhance productivity and user experience by:

Automating Repetitive Tasks: Filling out job applications, client forms, and other repetitive forms seamlessly.
Saving Time and Reducing Errors: Eliminating the manual hassle of filling forms and ensuring accuracy.
Integrating Across Platforms: Providing a freemium model for individuals and advanced features for businesses, ensuring scalability and accessibility.

### :zap: [Market Segmentation Study Task]()
In this study task, I, along with four other members, worked on Market Segmentation (MS), and highlighted the key points theoretically and practically (using Python) that are vital to MS.

### :zap: [Market Segmentation Analysis of the Indian Electric Vehicle Market]()
In this subsequent project, I collaborated with four fellow members to address the assigned task: conduct an analysis of the electric vehicles market in India through Market Segmentation techniques. Our objective was to devise a viable market entry strategy that revolves around targeting the Geographic, Demographic, Psychographic and Behavioral segments.


### :zap: [AI Tutor]()
Mobiles have become an integral part of the lives of human beings. Today, these technical devices serve a multitude of purposes for example calling, video calls, texts, internet, mailing, playing games, taking pictures, shopping etc. Due to these very purposes, buyers often take many factors into consideration while purchasing a mobile such as brand, processor, memory size (internal & external), camera, battery backup among others. Among these considerations, however, one factor that generally causes confusion is the *price*. As such, we built a Machine Learning model using Linear Regression to predict the price of a mobile based on its features.
