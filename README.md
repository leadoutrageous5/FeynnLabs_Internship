### :zap: [AI Product/Service Ideation Task]()
For this solo project, titled *ML-Powered Form Autofill Application*, I propose the idea of creating a browser extension and API that automates form-filling tasks using Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
This service, if implemented successfully, will significantly enhance productivity and user experience by:

Automating Repetitive Tasks: Filling out job applications, client forms, and other repetitive forms seamlessly.
Saving Time and Reducing Errors: Eliminating the manual hassle of filling forms and ensuring accuracy.
Integrating Across Platforms: Providing a freemium model for individuals and advanced features for businesses, ensuring scalability and accessibility.
